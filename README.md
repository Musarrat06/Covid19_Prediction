# üîç **COVID-19 Prediction Project** ü¶† - **Machine Learning**

During these challenging times, I undertook a meaningful data science project aimed at predicting COVID-19 outcomes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, I developed models to predict whether an individual would test positive or negative for COVID-19 based on key symptoms and demographic factors. This involved data preprocessing, feature selection, and employing various algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

üìä **Key Achievements:**

Conducted thorough data analysis and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data quality.
Employed feature selection techniques to identify the most impactful predictors for the model.
Implemented diverse machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Trees.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualized critical insights through data visualizations, including scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices.

This project allowed me to contribute positively during the pandemic by creating a tool to aid in the accurate and timely identification of potential COVID-19 cases. I gained valuable experience in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, showcasing my ability to tackle real-world challenges with data-driven solutions.
